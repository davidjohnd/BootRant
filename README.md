BOOTRANT
BootRant is a journalling app for bootcampers. It was conceived and built in one week as the mid-term project during the School of Code bootcamp. It was built using a mobile-first approach. You can find more details below.

The Problem
After conducting user research, we found that many of our cohort found journalling a great way to keep track of their pogress. They also said it was useful to rant to friends when they had a difficult day. So we set out to create a journalling app where users could save their posts as 'brags' and 'rants', but also use a 'Scream It!' function which would allow a user to get their thoughts down without saving them to get things off their chest if they had a bad day.
